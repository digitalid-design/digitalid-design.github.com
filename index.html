								<p>Any digital identity (e-identity) service is built on relationships between the identity provider, those whose digital identity it manages (individuals), and the service providers (government departments, private sector entities, etc). For such a service to be successful – that is, it is of value to the citizens and relying parties, and is sustainable over the long term – it is essential that all parties trust the service operator: citizens trust it to handle their private data securely and to manage their digital identity, and service providers trust it to ensure that the asserted identities are reliable.</p>

              				<p>This is the first in a series of research maps, resulting from our global survey of digital identity systems. Read together with our glossary of core concepts and processes, these maps provide a coherent view of digital identity in Estonia. They shine a light on the pervasiveness of digital identity, as well as dissect digital identity systems in a way that brings attention to the actions of key stakeholders, and to kinds of data and how they are shared. Designed as stepping stones to further research, the maps facilitate the identification of points of accountability and intervention.</p>

              				<p>Digital identification systems present a set of unique challenges for both implementing agencies and users. As countries around the world roll out their digital ID systems — for purposes such as financial inclusion and access, providing easier access to healthcare services, aiding the disbursal of government rations, subsidies, etc. — there are concerns around the efficacy of and privacy offered by such systems. The ID4D Workshop on Good ID in Practice sought to arrive at practical solutions to some of these challenges.</p>

							<p>This post presents our comments to the <em>ID4D Practitioners’ Guide: Draft For Consultation</em> released by ID4D in June, 2019. CIS has conducted research on issues related to digital identity since 2012. This submission is divided into three main parts. The first part (General Comments) contains the high-level comments on the Practitioners’ Guide, while the second part (Specific Comments) addresses individual sections in the Guide. The third and final part (Additional Comments) does not relate to particulars in the Practitioners' Guide but other documents that it relies upon. We submitted these comments to ID4D on August 5, 2019.</p>

							<p>In our research project about uses & design of digital identity systems, we ask two core questions: a) <em>What are appropriate uses of ID?</em>, and b) <em>How should we think about the technological design of ID?</em> Towards the first research question, we have worked on first principles and will further develop definitions, legal tests and applications of these principles. Towards the second research question, we have first identified a set of existing and planned digital identity systems that represent a paradigm of how such a system can be envisioned and implemented, and will look to identify key design choices which are causing divergence in paradigm.</p>

							<h2>The Appropriate Use of Digital Identity</h2>
							<p id="date">June 11, 2019</p>
							<p id="blurb">Read and comment: <a href="evaluation-framework-01.html">Draft framework</a> by CIS</p>
							<p id="blurb">Download: <a href="http://bit.ly/CISDigitalIDAppropriateUse">Working drafts</a> by CIPIT, CIS, and ITS</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>As governments across the globe implement new, foundational, digital identification systems (“Digital ID”), or modernize existing ID programs, there is dire need for greater research and discussion about appropriate uses of Digital ID systems. This significant momentum for creating Digital ID in several parts of the world has been accompanied with concerns about the privacy and exclusion harms of a state issued
							Digital ID system, resulting in campaigns and litigations in countries such as UK, India, Kenya, and Jamaica. Given the very large range of considerations required to evaluate Digital ID projects, it is necessary to think of evaluation frameworks that can be used for this purpose.</p>
							<p>At RightsCon 2019 in Tunis, we are presenting <a href="http://bit.ly/CISDigitalIDAppropriateUse">working drafts</a> on appropriate use of Digital ID by the partner organisations of this <a href="https://www.omidyar.com/blog/appropriate-use-digital-identity-why-we-invested-three-region-research%C2%A0alliance" target="_blank">three-region research alliance</a> - ITS from Brazil, CIPIT from Kenya, and CIS from India.</p>
							<p>In the <a href="evaluation-framework-01.html" target="_blank">draft by CIS</a>, we propose a set of principles against which Digital ID may be evaluated. We hope that these draft principles can evolve into a set of best practices that can be used by policymakers when they create and implement Digital ID systems, provide guidance to civil society examinations of Digital ID and highlight questions for further research on the subject. We have drawn from approaches used in documents such as the necessary and proportionate principles, the OECD privacy guidelines and scholarship on harms based approaches.</p>

							<h2>Research Grant on Digital Identities: Design and Uses</h2>
							<p id="date">May 7, 2019</p>
							<p id="blurb">Read: <a href="https://www.omidyar.com/blog/appropriate-use-digital-identity-why-we-invested-three-region-research%C2%A0alliance" target="_blank">Announcement</a> of the research alliance</p>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>We are happy to announce a new research grant on Digital Identities at the Centre for Internet and Society (CIS). This grant is supported by <a href="https://www.omidyarnetwork.in/" target="_blank">Omidyar Network India</a>, as part of a three region alliance to be co-led by the <a href="https://itsrio.org/en/en-home/" target="_blank">Institute for Technology & Society (ITS), Brazil</a>, the <a href="https://www.cipit.org/" target="_blank">Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Technology Law (CIPIT)</a>, Kenya, and the CIS, India — on the Appropriate Use of Digital Identity. As part of this Alliance, we at the CIS will look at the policy objectives of digital identity projects, how technological policy choices can be thought through to meet the objectives, and how legitimate uses of a digital identity framework may be evaluated.</p>
							<p>There is significant momentum on creation of digital identity projects especially after the adoption of <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg16" target="_blank">UN Sustainable Development Goal 16.9</a>, which calls for legal identity for all by 2030. Given the importance of this subject, its implications for both the development agenda as well its impact on civil, social and economic rights, there is a need for more focused research that can enable policymakers to take better decisions, guide civil society in different jurisdictions to comment on and raise questions about digital identity schemes, and provide actionable material to the industry to create identity solutions that are privacy enhancing and inclusive. We look forward to producing research that can contribute to the above.</p>
