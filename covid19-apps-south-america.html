        <p class="intro">Governments have deployed various kinds of public-facing digital measures to manage the spread of COVID-19 and address the deep impact of the crisis on people’s well-being. A popular measure has been in the form of mobile-apps. The overarching objective has been to enable governments to conduct contact-tracing and monitor spread to take necessary action. On the other hand for individuals, the apps offer guidance for self-diagnoses, fixing of medical appointments, sending alerts in case of exposure to infected people, etc.</p>
        <p class="indent">The apps collect personal information such as demographic data, health data, and location data. Based on these, the apps can ‘authorise’ individuals’ access to services and movement. Such determinations can have far-reaching consequences for individuals and society, well beyond the intended ones. It is necessary to evaluate how the apps fare in terms of their legality, respect for human rights, and mitigation of potential risks and harms. In May-June 2020, <a href="https://itsrio.org/en/en-home/">Institute of Technology Studies (ITS Rio)</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/cis_india/status/1291268615015002112">evaluated</a> COVID-19 apps from five countries in South America (<a href="https://feed.itsrio.org/colombias-coronapp-5802ceb54b7">Colombia</a>, <a href="https://feed.itsrio.org/ecuadors-saludec-3848b3a0c4e5">Ecuador</a>, <a href="https://feed.itsrio.org/mexicos-covid-radar-58bc38ae4fc1">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://feed.itsrio.org/per%C3%BA-en-tus-manos-20c873452ca4">Peru</a>, and <a href="https://feed.itsrio.org/brazils-aux%C3%ADlio-emergencial-and-caixa-tem-apps-6a4a5de68468">Brazil</a>). The studies applied CIS India’s <a href="https://digitalid.design/evaluation-framework-02.html">Digital ID Evaluation Framework</a> to find out how these apps adhered to the rule of law and individuals’ human rights, and whether they properly took into account potential risks and harms. It should be noted that in Brazil’s case, the evaluation pertained to apps that enable transfer of financial benefits, as opposed to apps doing contact tracing, monitoring, and provision of health services in other countries. This blog post highlights the key findings in the five country-studies.</p>
        <p class="indent">Firstly, checking the legal basis for deployment, apps in <a href="https://feed.itsrio.org/colombias-coronapp-5802ceb54b7">Colombia</a>, <a href="https://feed.itsrio.org/ecuadors-saludec-3848b3a0c4e5">Ecuador</a>, <a href="https://feed.itsrio.org/mexicos-covid-radar-58bc38ae4fc1">Mexico</a>, <a href="https://feed.itsrio.org/per%C3%BA-en-tus-manos-20c873452ca4">Peru</a> operate without any specific legislative backing. These countries also comply with rights-principles only to a limited extent and do not have any risk analyses or mitigation steps laid out. In contrast, <a href="https://feed.itsrio.org/brazils-aux%C3%ADlio-emergencial-and-caixa-tem-apps-6a4a5de68468">Brazil</a>’s apps are backed by a robust legal mandate and abide by most rights-principles, but have had serious exclusionary impact and fare just as poorly as the rest on risk analysis and mitigation.</p>
        <p class="indent">In <a href="https://feed.itsrio.org/colombias-coronapp-5802ceb54b7">Colombia</a>, in return for registration on the app, users get free zero-rating internet packs. This has compelled the low-income population in the country to register; otherwise user registration is mandatory for certain purposes only such as conducting a self-diagnostic test. The app does not conduct contact-tracing. There is no reference or adherence to the existing data protection framework, and the app’s terms of use (ToU) do not accurately indicate the specific sensitive data collected. Despite the stated mandate of the app being to process data during COVID-19 only, the ToU does not contain information on destruction or anonymisation of the data.</p>
        <p class="indent"><a href="https://feed.itsrio.org/ecuadors-saludec-3848b3a0c4e5">Ecuador</a> provides more functionalities for users than Colombia, such as fixing of medical appointments via the app. User registration is mandatory to access the app (with a national ID, thus making it inaccessible to foreigners) – even merely for receiving recommendations and information from the government. The app has been developed by a third-party who is also the owner of the app, and can process data. There is no data protection framework in the country. This app gathers geolocation data for monitoring and at the same time offers telemedicine services – the combination of which can be misused to profile the population. Concerns of profiling are amplified in the absence of a clear delineation of actors who may access the data.</p>
        <p class="indent"><a href="https://feed.itsrio.org/per%C3%BA-en-tus-manos-20c873452ca4">Peru</a> also requires mandatory registration to use the app, however, the app can be accessed by citizens and foreigners both with a Peruvian mobile number. Sharing geolocation data is a prerequisite to access the app. Similar to Ecuador, this app also gathers geolocation data and offers telemedicine services at the same time, and raises serious risks for profiling.</p>
        <p class="indent">In <a href="https://feed.itsrio.org/mexicos-covid-radar-58bc38ae4fc1">Mexico</a>, contact-tracing is the primary aim of the app. The app can be used without sharing identity information or registering, and overall is aligned well with international privacy best practices for contact-tracing apps. It has been developed by a private company and is being run by the government. There are rules in place to ensure that the data is not transmitted for commercial purposes, however, which actors (public or private) exactly have access to data is not known. There is a data protection framework in place with a functional regulatory authority.</p>
        <p class="indent">In <a href="https://feed.itsrio.org/brazils-aux%C3%ADlio-emergencial-and-caixa-tem-apps-6a4a5de68468">Brazil</a>, two apps work concomitantly to distribute welfare payments to people. One helps users register to determine eligibility for receiving benefits, and the other is for creating an online savings bank account to receive the cash transfer. The apps are run by one of the main state-owned banks in Brazil responsible for welfare payments... Of the 95 million people who had applied via the apps, 57 million received the benefit, 37 million were denied access and the remaining were under review. This led to legal actions against the government. Applying the framework – the apps fare well in terms of legal mandate, defining roles of actors managing and using the platform (only public sector entities permitted), and operating within the ambit of data protection framework. There was no risk assessment exercise conducted in advance; mandating the national ID (CPF) to register (when the registries for the CPF  were not robust) coupled with an online-smartphone-app-only mechanism created a severe exclusionary impact.</p>
