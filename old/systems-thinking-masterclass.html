							<p>The masterclass was aimed at learning to address complex problems using systems thinking approach. It involved experiential and collaborative learning through discussions, and doing and making activities. The workshop began with identifying different actors, processes, institutions, and other entities involved in a complex problem. The method of role-playing was introduced to learn to detail out and map the problem. Concepts such as synergy/ emergence, relationships, and flows were introduced through examples and case studies. These concepts were applied while mapping complex problems to find insights such as patterns, purposes, feedback loops, and finally a leverage. The workshop also introduced the idea of ephemeralization. Participants were prompted to find solutions that require least input but have greatest impact.</p>
