		<p class="intro">This series of research maps, based on our global survey of digital identity systems, is for India. Read together with our glossary of core concepts and processes, these maps provide a coherent view of digital identity in India. They shine a light on the pervasiveness of digital identity, as well as dissect digital identity systems in a way that brings attention to the actions of key stakeholders, and to kinds of data and how they are shared. Designed as stepping stones to further research, the maps facilitate the identification of points of accountability and intervention.</p>
		<p>The Digital ID system in India, Aadhaar was launched in 2010, with the primary aim to improve the Public Distribution System in the country. It is managed by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). The Digital ID system includes the Unique Identification (UID) numbers, called ‘Aadhaar,’ which can be assigned to all residents of India. The Aadhaar number is a random 12-digit number issued by the UIDAI after a verification process. The enrollment and authentication processes are conducted by the UIDAI. The enrolment process includes capturing demographic and biometric data from residents.</p>
		<p class="indent">Aadhaar is currently used for identity verification in several private and public services by linking the Aadhaar numbers of residents with their mobile SIM cards, bank accounts, and a large number of welfare schemes. Other key digital services that have been planned are in the healthcare and finance sectors. While Aadhaar is envisioned to be used by state and private hospitals for registration and appointments, and for identification in other government healthcare schemes, there is also the proposed National Health Stack, which will include an identifier for beneficiaries. It is not yet confirmed if this identifier will be Aadhaar number itself or a new unique ID. In the finance sector, a set of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) for provision of financial infrastructure for governments, businesses, startups, and developers called India Stack has been created. IndiaStack currently includes the following APIs — DigiLocker, e-KYC, e-Sign, Aadhaar Auth, and UPI.</p>

		<p>The core processes within each digital identity system are being mapped in order to evaluate the existing technological and policy decisions. These process maps bring forward the advantages and barriers in the mechanisms of identification, authentication, and authorisation. These maps follow the Swim Lane Model to capture these processes. The use of this technique helps to read the processes with clarity, and also points out the multiple possibilities at different steps.</p>
		<p class="indent">The Swim Lane Model represents a process as a sequence of steps, and places the entities in different lanes (or columns) to show who is responsible for taking those steps. Each column shows the action taken by the respective entity. The numbered rows establish the sequence of steps. The arrows connect the end of each step to the beginning of the next one. Refer to the key on the right to navigate the process maps. They also indicate multiple routes that can be taken within a step. Additionally, these process maps highlight the data being collected and digital identity artifacts being used in various steps.</p>

        <p>As part of the systems thinking approach, sectoral use cases have been mapped to understand how the digital identity system in Estonia has been conceptualised and implemented. Studying these sectors allows a closer look at the various purposes of the digital identity, and how the residents, and state and private actors interact with it. The ERAF technique of systems mapping has been used for these maps to give a holistic view of the system and connections within it. It is an analytical tool rather than a representational tool. The ERAF model helps to place the various constituents involved in the system and divides them into entities, relationships, attributes, and flows. This <a href="http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/ ">technique of mapping</a> reveals missing connections and flows in a system, and leads to the identification of specific leverage points where a small shift can produce a big impact on the system.</p>
		<p class="indent">In the ERAF model, entities are the key components. These could be individuals, institutions, laws, places, etc. Relationships describe the way in which different entities are connected to each other. Attributes are characteristics that describe the entities. These could be duration, dimensions, costs, etc. The Flows show the direction of action between entities. This includes transaction of data and resources. Data and its flow within the system, and digital identity artifacts have been highlighted in these maps.</p>
