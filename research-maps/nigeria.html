		<p class="intro">In this series of exploratory research maps, we examine the digital identity system in Nigeria. This is part of our global survey of digital identity systems. These maps can be read together with our glossary of core concepts and processes. They illustrate the pervasiveness of digital identity, as well as dissect digital identity systems in a way that brings attention to the actions of key stakeholders, and to kinds of data and how they are shared. Designed as stepping stones to further research, the maps facilitate the identification of points of accountability and intervention.</p>
		<p>The digital ID system in Nigeria includes the National Identity Number (NIN) and the National Electronic Identity Card (e-ID card). The NIN is a unique eleven digit number, randomly chosen and assigned to an individual at the completion of enrolment into the National Identity Database (NIDB). The NIN can be used to establish or verify the identity of an individual for availing services such as travel, opening bank accounts, and accessing welfare and other relevant services from the Nigerian Government. It is mandatory for every citizen and legal resident to enrol for the NIN. It can be issued to citizens and legal residents of all ages. The e-ID Card however, is issued to citizens and residents who have attained the age of sixteen years and above.</p>
		<p class="indent">The National e-ID Card is a chip based card with multiple functions, that acts as an additional physical token to the NIN. The NIN can be used on its own for digital identity verification without the e-ID card. But, the e-ID card cannot be used on its own for digital identity verification without the NIN first being stored within its chip. The NIN and the eID Card are both issued by the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC). The NIMC aims to harmonize the data with various agencies across Nigeria in order to make the process of accessing services through the NIN more efficient.</p>

		<p>The core processes within each digital identity system are being mapped in order to evaluate the existing technological and policy decisions. These process maps bring forward the advantages and barriers in the mechanisms of identification, authentication, and authorisation. These maps follow the Swim Lane Model to capture these processes. The use of this technique helps to read the processes with clarity, and also points out the multiple possibilities at different steps.</p>
		<p class="indent">The Swim Lane Model represents a process as a sequence of steps, and places the entities in different lanes (or columns) to show who is responsible for taking those steps. Each column shows the action taken by the respective entity. The numbered rows establish the sequence of steps. The arrows connect the end of each step to the beginning of the next one. Refer to the key on the right to navigate the process maps. They also indicate multiple routes that can be taken within a step. Additionally, these process maps highlight the data being collected and digital identity artifacts being used in various steps.</p>

		<p>The NIN is a unique number issued by the NIMC to individuals after an enrolment process that includes the recording of demographic and biometric information, and digital signature. This data is stored in the National Identity Database, and is linked by the unique NIN. For minors, the process of enrolment is the same, except they must be accompanied by a parent/guardian. The parent/guardian’s NIN Slip must be provided for the process, along with supporting documents. There is no enrollment fee for acquiring the NIN.</p>

The NIMC sends a Batch ID to the individual which is used to collect the Card from a NIMC Card Collection Centre. The individual is issued the Card upon successful biometric verification. The applications linked to the Card are also activated after this process. Minors receive an intimation through SMS when they turn sixteen to update their data and obtain their e-ID Card.</p>

The Card comprises a chip that stores the individual’s NIN and biometric information, the Primary Account Number (PAN) and Card Verification Value (CVV) for MasterCard Payment, and the Machine Readable Zone (MRZ) lines for travel purposes. During authentication, the individual’s biometrics are matched with those stored on the Card. Upon successful verification, the individual can access the desired service.</p>

        <p>As part of the systems thinking approach, sectoral use cases have been mapped to understand how the digital identity system in Nigeria has been conceptualised and implemented. Studying these sectors allows a closer look at the various purposes of the digital identity, and how the individuals, and state and private actors interact with it. The ERAF technique of systems mapping has been used for these maps to give a holistic view of the system and connections within it. It is an analytical tool rather than a representational tool. The ERAF model helps to place the various constituents involved in the system and divides them into entities, relationships, attributes, and flows. This <a href="http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/ ">technique of mapping</a> reveals missing connections and flows in a system, and leads to the identification of specific leverage points where a small shift can produce a big impact on the system.</p>
		<p class="indent">In the ERAF model, entities are the key components. These could be individuals, institutions, laws, places, etc. Relationships describe the way in which different entities are connected to each other. Attributes are characteristics that describe the entities. These could be duration, dimensions, costs, etc. The Flows show the direction of action between entities. This includes transaction of data and resources. Data and its flow within the system, and digital identity artifacts have been highlighted in these maps.</p>

		<p>The payment application on the e-ID Card allows for money to be transferred, paid into, or loaded into the Card. Individuals can use the Card through any of the available payment platforms/options. It can also be used to pay for goods and services such as utility bills, flight tickets, and water bills. The Electronic Identity (e-ID) application can be used as a Know Your Customer (KYC) tool for banks and other financial institutions. The e-Taxation and e-Insurance applications, which are yet to be implemented, will enable the e-ID Card to serve as a self-service tax payment channel, and to administer and renew insurance policies respectively.</p>

		<p>The individuals are required to state their NIN during transactions related to health insurance schemes, and use of health or medical services. The NIN is also used to access the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). Another ID in the healthcare system is the e-Yellow Card. It is issued for people who have been vaccinated against yellow fever. This has come as a replacement to the paper certificates of vaccination. Both Nigerian residents and nationals, and international travellers need to register for a e-Yellow Card through an online portal, and obtain it from the Port Health Services.</p>

Another functionality that is yet to be implemented is the e-Transport applet, which would allow ID holders to use their ID card as travel cards comprising a credit-based payment system for public transport.</p>

		<h4>Welfare Schemes</h4>
		<p>The use of National Identity Number (NIN) in the Nigerian welfare sector is aimed at making the process of accessing the retirement benefits more streamlined. At the time of new registration, all the necessary details of the individual are pulled up by the National Pension Commission (PENCOM) from the National Identity Database (NIDB) electronically so that the individual is not required to re-enter the common details like age, gender, address etc. In case of an existing Resident Savings Account (RSA) the individual can approach PENCOM for updation of their account with e-ID for linking. This, in-turn, maintains a level of cohesion between all the benefits for the individual.</p>

		<h4>Governance</h4>
		<p>The NIN is linked to the Nigerian Permanent Voter Card (PVC), which will be authenticated while voting. The existing data that the Nigerian Voting Commission has on the individuals also helped set up the National Identity Database (NIDB). When a new individual is being registered, only the data apart from what was recorded via the NIN is required. The e-ID card will also have an e-Voting application in the future, which will enable it to serve as the individual’s voter card. The e-ID card, however, is not going to replace the PVC, but has rather been designed to complement it.</p>
