		<p class="intro">This is the first in a series of research maps, resulting from our global survey of digital identity systems. Read together with our <a href="../core-concepts-processes.html" target="_blank">glossary of core concepts and processes</a>, these maps provide a coherent view of digital identity in Estonia. They shine a light on the pervasiveness of digital identity, as well as dissect digital identity systems in a way that brings attention to the actions of key stakeholders, and to kinds of data and how they are shared. Designed as stepping stones to further research, the maps facilitate the identification of points of accountability and intervention.</p>
		<p>As a result of a national eID card being mandatory, nearly 1.3 million Estonian citizens have a permanent personal ID code, which forms the basis of the digital identification process. The different forms of identification in the Estonian Digital ID ecosystem are Digi-ID (in the form of a smart card), Mobile ID (via a special SIM to be inserted in a smartphone) and Smart ID (an application for smartphones and tablets that does not require a special SIM). These multiple forms of identification can be used to access various services and to digitally sign documents. These IDs are available to all citizens and residents, as well as e-residents, of Estonia. </p>
		<p class="indent">Estonia’s e-solution environment empowers residents and citizens to avail of almost every government service online, in addition to many private services. This system entails each service having their own information system. X-Road provides an open-source interoperability platform between these different information systems. Different X-Road ecosystems can also be joined and federated. </p>
		<p class="indent">The various actors in the Digital ID ecosystem (in addition to ID users) that avail of this ID include both public and private actors. These actors differ according to the form and purpose of ID. Major actors include state authorities such as the Police and Border Guard Board; state services such as the Estonian Health Information System; state databases such as the Estonian Population Register and Identity Documents Database; and private entities such as Telecom Service Providers.</p>

		<p>The core processes within each digital identity system are being mapped in order to evaluate the existing technological and policy decisions. These process maps bring forward the advantages and barriers in the mechanisms of identification, authentication, and authorisation. These maps follow the Swim Lane Model to capture these processes. The use of this technique helps to read the processes with clarity, and also points out the multiple possibilities at different steps.</p>
		<p class="indent">The Swim Lane Model represents a process as a sequence of steps, and places the entities in different lanes (or columns) to show who is responsible for taking those steps. Each column shows the action taken by the respective entity. The numbered rows establish the sequence of steps. The arrows connect the end of each step to the beginning of the next one <em>(refer to the key to navigate the process maps)</em>. They also indicate multiple routes that can be taken within a step. Additionally, these process maps highlight the data being collected and digital identity artifacts being used in various steps.</p>

		<h4>Digi ID</h4>
		<p>The digital identity card (Digi-ID) is a smart ID card that can be used by citizens and residents of Estonia. The Digi-ID can be used for authentication and digital signatures, but cannot be used as visual identification, as its purpose is to be used in a digital environment. Use of the Digi-ID requires a card reader, and the validity of the Digi-ID is 5 years. This map shows the process of a resident obtaining a Digi-ID from the Police and Border Guard Board.</p>

		<p>Smart ID is a free mobile application that allows a user to prove their identity online in the absence of a SIM card on their smart device. It can be used to access financial e-services, confirm transactions and agreements. In addition, Smart ID has been recognised by the European Union as a Qualified Signature Creation Device (QSCD), which means that digital signatures through it must be recognised by every European State. This map illustrates the process of signing up for a Smart ID through a smartphone or tablet.</p>

		<h4>Digi ID</h4>
		<p>For authentication and digital signatures a Digi-ID card, a smart card reader, and the PIN1 and PIN 2 contained on the smart card are required. The resident opens the web interface, which asks the resident for their ID card. The ID card is inserted into a smart card reader, following which the resident enters PIN1 into the web interface, which then authenticates the certificate in the ID card. To authenticate digital signatures, the resident opens the web interface which shows the document to be signed. On clicking the option to sign, the web interface requires the resident to insert the ID card into the smart card reader. Once the resident approves the document, the web interface requires them to enter PIN2, following which the resident is able to submit the document.</p>

		<h3>X-Road Interoperability</h3>
		<p>X-Road is an interoperability service that links each separate public and private sector e-information system and enables them to communicate  seamlessly with each other without human intervention. All information is held in a distributed data system which can exchange information instantly upon request and be accessed 24/7. It can write to multiple information systems, transmit large data sets and perform searches across several information systems simultaneously. All incoming data is authenticated and logged, and all outgoing data is digitally signed and encrypted in order to ensure data security. This map illustrates how X-Road enables interoperability between different services and departments.</p>

        <p>As part of the systems thinking approach, sectoral use cases have been mapped to understand how the digital identity system in Estonia has been conceptualised and implemented. Studying these sectors allows a closer look at the various purposes of the digital identity, and how the residents, and state and private actors interact with it. The ERAF technique of systems mapping has been used for these maps to give a holistic view of the system and connections within it. It is an analytical tool rather than a representational tool. The ERAF model helps to place the various constituents involved in the system and divides them into entities, relationships, attributes, and flows. This technique of mapping reveals missing connections and flows in a system, and leads to the identification of specific leverage points where a small shift can produce a big impact on the system. </p>
		<p class="indent">In the ERAF model, entities are the key components. These could be individuals, institutions, laws, places, etc. Relationships describe the way in which different entities are connected to each other. Attributes are characteristics that describe the entities. These could be duration, dimensions, costs, etc. The Flows show the direction of action between entities. This includes transaction of data and resources. Data and its flow within the system, and digital identity artifacts have been highlighted in these maps <em>(refer to the key to navigate the process maps)</em>.</p>
