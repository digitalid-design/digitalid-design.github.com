		<p class="intro">As part of our global survey of digital identity systems, this series of comprehensive research maps provides a coherent view of digital identity in the United Kingdom. These can be read along with our <a href="../core-concepts-processes.html" target="_blank">glossary of core concepts and processes</a>. They illustrate the pervasiveness of digital identity, as well as dissect digital identity systems in a way that brings attention to the actions of key stakeholders, and to kinds of data and how they are shared. Designed as stepping stones to further research, the maps facilitate the identification of points of accountability and intervention.</p>
		<p>The digital ID in the United Kingdom is in the form of GOV.UK Verify platform, and systems within the National Health Service (NHS).</p>
		<p class="indent">GOV.UK Verify was developed by the Government Digital Service (GDS) as an identity verification platform to securely access online government services. The platform is <a href="../core-concepts-processes.html#idsystem" target="_blank">federated</a>, which means that residents can choose from a range of “identity providers” certified by the government. These identity providers verify the identities of residents, and provide login credentials to them to authenticate their identity. The providers are tasked with verifying the information provided by the applicant, and subsequently confirming the ID holder’s identity to the government service each time the ID holder is accessing that service. Currently, there are five identity providers in the UK. These include both private and public sector companies. GOV.UK is used across a range of public-sector services such as to apply for universal credit, file income tax, monitor state pension, apply for jobs, renew drivers license, etc. </p>
		<p class="indent">The National Health Service (NHS) is the publicly-funded healthcare system of the UK, which uses digital ID  to provide services in the form of a patient identifier, the NHS Number, and smartcards for healthcare staff.</p>

		<p>The core processes within each digital identity system are being mapped in order to evaluate the existing technological and policy decisions. These process maps bring forward the advantages and barriers in the mechanisms of identification, authentication, and authorisation. These maps follow the Swim Lane Model to capture these processes. The use of this technique helps to read the processes with clarity, and also points out the multiple possibilities at different steps.</p>
		<p class="indent">The Swim Lane Model represents a process as a sequence of steps, and places the entities in different lanes (or columns) to show who is responsible for taking those steps. Each column shows the action taken by the respective entity. The numbered rows establish the sequence of steps. The arrows connect the end of each step to the beginning of the next one <em>(refer to the key to navigate the process maps)</em>. They also indicate multiple routes that can be taken within a step. Additionally, these process maps highlight the data being collected and digital identity artifacts being used in various steps.</p>

		<h4>GOV.UK Verify</h4>
		<p>The United Kingdom government uses the GOV.UK Verify platform for authentication (called “identity assurance” within this system) in order to provide digital services. The platform uses five commercial identity providers to conduct verification — Barclays, Digidentity, Experian, Post Office, and Secure Identity. GOV.UK Verify can be used by residents of the UK. There are nineteen online government services that are connected to the platform. Different identity providers require different data to conduct verification. The following map shows the process of a resident being verified by an identity provider and assigning them a Verify credential with corresponding account and login details. </p>

        <p>As part of the systems thinking approach, sectoral use cases have been mapped to understand how the digital identity system in the UK has been conceptualised and implemented. Studying these sectors allows a closer look at the various purposes of the digital identity, and how the residents, and state and private actors interact with it. The ERAF technique of systems mapping has been used for these maps to give a holistic view of the system and connections within it. It is an analytical tool rather than a representational tool. The ERAF model helps to place the various constituents involved in the system and divides them into entities, relationships, attributes, and flows. This technique of mapping reveals missing connections and flows in a system, and leads to the identification of specific leverage points where a small shift can produce a big impact on the system.</p>
		<p class="indent">In the ERAF model, entities are the key components. These could be individuals, institutions, laws, places, etc. Relationships describe the way in which different entities are connected to each other. Attributes are characteristics that describe the entities. These could be duration, dimensions, costs, etc. The Flows show the direction of action between entities. This includes transaction of data and resources. Data and its flow within the system, and digital identity artifacts have been highlighted in these maps.</p>
